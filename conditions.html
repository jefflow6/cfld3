   <p><h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>     
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that involves a decrease or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe. It occurs when the muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissue in the back of the throat to collapse and block the upper airway. This leads to partial reductions (hypopneas) and complete pauses(apneas) in breathing that last at least 10 seconds during sleep. Most pauses last between10 and 30 seconds, but some may persist for one minute or longer. This can lead to abrupt reductions in blood oxygen saturation, with oxygen levels falling as much as 40percent or more in severe cases.</p>

    <p><h3>COPD</h3>
COPD is a medical term that stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

The word ‘Chronic’ means it won’t go away.
The word ‘Obstructive’ means limiting airflow.
The word ‘Pulmonary’ means in the lungs.
The word ‘Disease’ means an illness.
Many people with COPD have a combination of emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma. You may also hear COPD referred to as COAD (Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease), COLD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) or CAL (Chronic Airways Limitation). COPD cannot be cured or reversed, but it can be treated. </p>

    <h3>Asthma</h3>  
    
<p> Asthma is a chronic breathing disorder affecting both children and adults. It is characterized by:

Cough, severe shortness of breath, chest tightness and wheeze1 and usually occurs after exposure to allergens, viral infections and exercise or exposure to irritants such as fumes and cigarette smoke.
Inflammation of the airway wall and abnormal narrowing of the airways which may lead to asthma symptoms.
An asthma attack can be frightening with feelings of suffocation, breathlessness, and loss of control, and can be potentially life threatening.
Asthma can develop at any age, but is most common in childhood.
It is the leading cause of hospital admission for children. </p>

  <h3>Insomnia </h3> 
 <p>Insomnia is a common sleep complaint that occurs when you have one or more of these problems:

You have a hard time initiating sleep.
You struggle to maintain sleep, waking up frequently during the night.
You tend to wake up too early and are unable to go back to sleep.
You sleep is non-restorative or of poor quality.
These symptoms of insomnia can be caused by a variety of biological, psychological and social factors. They most often result in an inadequate amount of sleep, even though the sufferer has the opportunity to get a full night of sleep. Insomnia is different from sleep deprivation, which occurs when an individual does not have the opportunity to get a full night of sleep. A small percentage of people who have trouble sleeping are actually short sleepers who can function normally on only five hours of sleep or less.

There are two types of insomnia – primary and secondary. Primary insomnia is sleeplessness that cannot be attributed to an existing medial, psychiatric or environmental cause (such as drug abuse or medications). Secondary insomnia is when symptoms of insomnia arise from a primary medical illness, mental disorders or other sleep disorders.It may also arise from the use, abuse or exposure to certain substances.  </p>
